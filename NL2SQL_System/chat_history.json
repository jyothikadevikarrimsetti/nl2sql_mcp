Investigate why high shipping costs are associated with returns/cancellations.\n\n5. **Business Implications & Notable Observations**\n- **Returns/Cancellations:** Many orders with shipping cost above \u20b915 are returned or cancelled, increasing logistics costs and impacting margins.\n- **Order Value vs. Shipping Cost:** Some low-value orders (e.g., \u20b9316.06 with \u20b918.94 shipping) may not be cost-effective.\n- **Customer Segmentation:** Organizational accounts and cash payments are common, indicating possible B2B or bulk orders.\n\n6. **Anomalies & Interesting Data Points**\n- **Low Value, High Shipping:** Orders like order_id 19 (\u20b9200.12 total, \u20b919.56 shipping) show shipping is a large part of the order value.\n- **High Discounts:** Some orders have high discounts (e.g., \u20b929.08 on a \u20b91,210.28 order), which, combined with high shipping, may lead to losses if returned or cancelled.\n\n**Sample Table:**\n\n| Order ID | Order Value | Shipping Cost | Status     | Payment Method |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n| 4        | \u20b98,201.34   | \u20b916.23        | Returned   | Cash          |\n| 5        | \u20b99,914.23   | \u20b919.71        | Pending    | Organization  |\n| 44       | \u20b91,210.28   | \u20b919.55        | Returned   | Organization  |\n| 49       | \u20b95,814.33   | \u20b918.73        | Cancelled  | Debit Card    |\n| 55       | \u20b97,033.07   | \u20b915.78        | Delivered  | Cash          |\n| 71       | \u20b9316.06     | \u20b918.94        | Cancelled  | Organization  |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOrders with shipping costs above \u20b915 are common across all order values and statuses, but are especially prone to returns and cancellations. Review shipping policies for low-value orders and analyze the impact of shipping costs on profitability. Reducing shipping costs or offering incentives for higher-value orders may improve delivery rates and customer satisfaction.", "data": {"columns": ["order_id", "customer_id", "order_date",
