"Here are the insights for all cancelled items:\n\n- There are a total of 200 cancelled order items in the dataset.\n- The cancelled items cover a wide range of products and order quantities (from 1 to 5 units per item).\n- Unit prices for cancelled items range from as low as \u20b918.29 to as high as \u20b9813.46.\n\nStatistical Insights:\n- The total value of cancelled items (line_total) is approximately \u20b91.92 lakhs.\n- The average value per cancelled item is about \u20b9960.\n- Discount percentages on cancelled items range from 0.63% to 14.79% (most items have discounts in the 2\u201312% range).\n- Tax percentages vary from 6.22% up to 17.83%, with most falling between 7\u201316%.\n\nBest Results & Recommendations:\n- The largest single cancelled item is order_item_id 61698 with a line total of \u20b94,067.3 (5 units at \u20b9813.46 each).\n- Cancellations are not concentrated in a single product or price range, indicating a broad distribution across the catalogue.\n- Investigate the top 10 highest value cancelled items (all above \u20b92,000) for potential process or product issues, as these represent the largest lost revenue per item.\n\nBusiness Implications & Notable Observations:\n- The total cancelled value of \u20b91.92 lakhs represents a significant lost revenue opportunity.\n- There is no clear pattern that higher discounts or lower taxes reduce cancellations; cancellations occur across all ranges.\n- Since cancellations are spread across many products and price points, focus should be on order process improvements, customer communication, and product quality checks rather than on a specific product or price segment.\n\nAnomalies & Interesting Data Points:\n- Several items with line totals above \u20b92,000 (e.g., order_item_id 61698, 98, 49, 21) are notable and should be reviewed for root causes.\n- There are also many low-value cancellations (e.g., items below \u20b9100), indicating that even low-ticket items are not immune to cancellation.\n\nIn summary:\nThere are 200 cancelled items totaling \u20b91.92 lakhs in lost value, with cancellations spread across all product types, price points, and discount/tax levels. The highest individual cancellation is \u20b94,067.3. No single pattern dominates, so a holistic review of the cancellation process and customer journey is recommended to reduce future cancellations.", "data": {"columns": ["order_item_id", "order_id",

improve revenue, it is recommended to analyse if certain product categories, price ranges, or vendors are more prone to cancellations.\n\nBusiness implications:\n- Monitoring and reducing cancellations should be a priority to enhance customer satisfaction and protect revenue.\n- Further analysis can help identify root causes and target improvements in product quality, descriptions, or

Statistical Insights:\n- Total Cancelled Items: 200\n- Product Variety: Cancellations include consumer goods (like \"Little Women\", \"Blue Women\", \"Commercial Accessories\") and organization-related items.\n- No single product dominates the cancellations; they are spread across different types.\n\n4. Recommendations:\n- Focus on the most frequently cancelled categories (decor, accessories, women\u2019s products) for further analysis.\n- Investigate organizational cancellations for possible systemic issues in bulk or B2B orders.\n\n5. Business Implications:\n- 200 cancellations may indicate issues with fulfillment, customer satisfaction, or order processing.\n- High cancellation rates in certain categories (decor, accessories) could signal inventory, pricing, or supply chain challenges.\n- Organizational cancellations may have a larger business impact due to higher order values.\n\n6. Anomalies or Interesting Data Points:\n- Multiple organization-related cancellations stand out and warrant targeted follow-up.\n- No duplicate product names are visible, suggesting cancellations are not concentrated on a single item.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Conduct a root cause analysis for the most cancelled product categories and organizational orders.\n- Monitor cancellation trends over time to see if this is an isolated spike or a recurring pattern.\n- Reach out to affected customers/organizations to understand reasons for cancellation and improve retention.\n\nIf you need a breakdown by
